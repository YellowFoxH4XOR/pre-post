# üìê Rules for Generating High-Accuracy UI Wireframe Documentation (Text & Diagram)

> Use this as a system prompt or design instruction for generating reliable, professional wireframe documentation applicable across various web and mobile frameworks. This includes both a detailed **textual description** and a corresponding **single, primary visual diagram**.

---

## 1. üéØ Define the Core Context

Start with a concise summary establishing the scene:
-   **What is it?** (e.g., "SaaS Dashboard Web App", "Mobile E-commerce App Screen", "User Profile Page")
-   **Which screen/view?** (e.g., "Dashboard Overview", "Product Details Screen", "Settings Form")
-   **Who is the target user?** (e.g., "Data Analysts", "Mobile Shoppers", "Registered Users")
-   **What is the primary goal of this screen?** (e.g., "To provide a high-level overview of key metrics", "To display product information and allow adding to cart", "To enable users to update their profile information")

## 2. üñºÔ∏è Accompanying Visual Diagram (Mandatory - Single Primary View)

**A single, primary low-fidelity visual diagram MUST accompany the textual description.**
-   **Purpose:** To provide a quick, visual overview of the layout, structure, and placement of key elements, typically representing the **desktop or primary view**.
-   **Fidelity:** Keep it simple (low-fidelity). Focus on boxes, placeholders, basic shapes, and minimal text labels for components. **Avoid high-fidelity styling, colors (unless explicitly part of basic structure), or detailed graphics.**
-   **Content:** Should clearly show the main regions (Header, Sidebar, Content, Footer), the arrangement of major UI elements (Cards, Forms, Buttons, Images), and their relative positions and hierarchy in the primary view.
-   **Format:** Can be a digital wireframe (e.g., using tools like Balsamiq, Figma, Sketch in lo-fi mode), a structured box diagram, or even a clear, legible hand-drawn sketch. The diagram should be easily understandable alongside the text description.

## 3. üß± Enumerate All Essential UI Elements (in Text)

List **every distinct UI element** visible on the screen *and* represented in the primary diagram, using common terminology:
-   **Header/App Bar:** (e.g., Contains Logo placeholder (left), Search Input box (center), User Menu icon (right))
-   **Navigation (Sidebar/Tabs/Bottom Nav):** (e.g., Vertical list area with link labels: Dashboard, Reports, Settings; or Horizontal tab indicators: Overview, Details)
-   **Card Elements:** (e.g., Rectangular containers representing cards, labeled: "KPI Card", "Recent Activity Card")
-   **Form Elements:** (e.g., Clearly demarcated form area with labeled boxes for Inputs (Name, Email), Checkbox markers, Dropdown indicator, and a "Submit" Button shape)
-   **Data Visualization Elements:** (e.g., Placeholder box labeled "Bar Chart Area" or "Line Graph")
-   **Button Elements:** (Represented as rectangles/buttons, labeled by function: "Save", "Cancel", "Add Item")
-   **List/Table Elements:** (e.g., A box representing a list area; A grid structure labeled "Data Table" with placeholder column headers)
-   **Other Interactive Elements:** (Show placeholders/icons for Filters, Tags, Modals, etc., as relevant)
-   **Text Content:** Use placeholder text (e.g., "Lorem Ipsum" or "Heading Text") in the diagram, but describe key text content (headings, labels) here in the text description.
-   **Image/Icon Elements:** Use simple placeholders (e.g., a box with an 'X' or a basic icon shape) in the diagram, describe their purpose here.

## 4. üìê Describe Layout, Hierarchy & Spacing (in Text)

Specify the arrangement and visual flow *as depicted in the primary diagram*, using standard layout concepts:
-   **Overall Layout Structure:** (Reference the diagram, e.g., "As shown in the diagram, the primary layout is: Fixed Header, Main area with Left Sidebar and Right Content panel.")
-   **Element Placement:** (Describe positions relative to the diagram, e.g., "The Search Bar is in the Header, right of the Logo (Diagram Ref: H2).", "Action Buttons are grouped bottom-right in the Form Area (Diagram Ref: F5).")
-   **Visual Hierarchy:** (Explain the prominence shown in the diagram, e.g., "The main Title (Diagram Ref: C1) is visually dominant.", "KPI Cards (Diagram Ref: C2-C4) occupy the top row of the content area.")
-   **Spacing & Alignment:** (Describe key spacing/alignment visible in the diagram, e.g., "Consistent spacing between Card elements is shown.", "Form labels are aligned above input fields.")

---

## 5. üì± Address Responsive / Adaptive Design (in Text)

Detail how the layout *shown in the primary diagram* adapts across different screen sizes. **Describe the changes textually**, referencing elements from the main diagram. *(Optionally, simplified diagrams for key breakpoints can be provided separately but are not required by default)*.
-   **Large Screens (Desktop):** This is typically represented by the main diagram. State this explicitly (e.g., "The accompanying diagram shows the large screen layout.")
-   **Medium Screens (Tablet):** Describe changes based on the main diagram (e.g., "On tablets, the Sidebar (Diagram Ref: Nav) collapses to icons. The Content Area grid (Diagram Ref: C2-C7) reflows to 2 columns.")
-   **Small Screens (Mobile):** Describe changes based on the main diagram (e.g., "On mobile, the Header (Diagram Ref: H1-H3) simplifies, showing only Logo and Menu Icon. Navigation (Diagram Ref: Nav) moves into a hamburger menu. Content Area elements (Diagram Ref: C1-C7) stack vertically.")
-   **Adaptation Mechanism (Conceptual):** Briefly mention the approach (e.g., "Using responsive techniques to reflow elements shown in the primary diagram.")

---

## 6. üé® Visual Style & Theme (Optional - Text Only)

Provide *textual* guidance on the intended aesthetic. **This should generally NOT be reflected in the low-fidelity diagram.**
-   **Style Keywords:** (e.g., "Clean", "Minimalist", "Corporate")
-   **Color Palette (Theme Colors):**
    -   Provide 3-5 key hex codes or color descriptions.
    -   Define semantic usage: (e.g., Primary Action, Background, Accent, Text)
    -   Optionally name the theme.
-   **Typography Basics:** (Optional: Specify font family, base size)
-   **General Styling Notes:** (Optional: e.g., "Rounded corners on buttons", "Subtle shadows on cards")

---

## 7. üìÑ Format the Output Consistently

Organize the generated **textual description** using this structure. Ensure it clearly complements the **single, accompanying visual diagram**.

1.  **Screen Context** (From step 1)
2.  **Reference to Visual Diagram** (Explicitly mention the diagram, e.g., "See accompanying wireframe diagram for the primary visual layout.")
3.  **Header / App Bar** (Text description)
4.  **Navigation Element(s)** (Text description)
5.  **Main Content Area Elements** (Text description)
6.  **Footer / Bottom Bar (if applicable)** (Text description)
7.  **Layout, Hierarchy & Spacing** (Text description referencing the diagram)
8.  **Responsive / Adaptive Design** (Text description of changes relative to the primary diagram)
9.  **Visual Style & Theme (Optional)** (Text description)

Use **bold headings** for sections and **bullet points** for lists. Ensure descriptions are detailed enough to understand the elements and layout shown in the diagram, and how that layout adapts.
